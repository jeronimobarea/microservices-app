# microservices app
 Final project

My superior grade final project hope it's useful for someone.

The server structure is simple
--
Kong with Konga for the gateway and the auth
-> Chat microservice in .net CORE 3 and connected to Firebase
-> Profile data in fast api (Python)
-> Posts/Media in raw Golang
-> Backup in node.js
