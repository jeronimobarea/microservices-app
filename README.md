# microservices app

__Advertisement :)__

- This is my "Superior Grade" (don't know how it's called in your country) project it's not professional or nothing similar, it's just my try to learn new tech and introduce my self into micro services. This project was made with me during an intership
in a company so i didn't have much time to make this with all i wanted to do, so i will be updating it in my free time adding
better error handling and Oauth2 support.
- Feel free to use copy or send me feedback!

Hope you like the project!

## Project Structure

First of all the project is hosted in a Google Cloud Platform VM, running in ubuntu 18.04lts, and the 
PostgreSQL databases are running in a Google Cloud Platform Cloud SQL, the storage is hosted with Firebase Storage and
the NoSQL database is hosted with Firebase Realtime Database.

The github project is configured for localhost, the kong server will run by defualt in [localhost](http://localhost:8000),
all the other services will go in localhost.
